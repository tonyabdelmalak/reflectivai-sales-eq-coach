  "discovery": [
    {
      question: "What open-ended question would you ask to uncover a physician's biggest challenge with current treatment protocols?",
      focusArea: "Open-ended questioning",
      context: "Focus on understanding pain points before presenting solutions",
      whyItMatters: "Open-ended questions reveal the physician's true concerns and priorities, allowing you to position your solution as addressing their specific needs rather than generic benefits.",
      howToUse: "Practice asking this question out loud. Notice how it invites detailed responses rather than yes/no answers. Use this in early conversations to build rapport and gather intelligence."
    },
    {
      question: "How would you follow up when a physician gives a surface-level answer like 'Everything is fine'?",
      focusArea: "Probing deeper",
      context: "Challenge assumptions and dig beneath initial responses",
      whyItMatters: "Surface-level answers often hide real concerns. Physicians may be polite or guarded initially. Your ability to probe respectfully separates average reps from top performers.",
      howToUse: "Role-play this scenario with a colleague. Practice follow-up questions like 'What does fine look like?' or 'If you could improve one thing, what would it be?'"
    },
    {
      question: "What would you ask to understand the physician's decision-making criteria for selecting treatments?",
      focusArea: "Decision criteria discovery",
      context: "Uncover what truly matters in their evaluation process",
      whyItMatters: "Understanding decision criteria allows you to align your value proposition with what the physician actually cares about—whether it's efficacy, safety, cost, ease of use, or patient compliance.",
      howToUse: "Ask this early in the relationship to guide all future conversations. Listen for both stated criteria (what they say matters) and revealed criteria (what their questions and concerns actually focus on)."
    },
    {
      question: "How would you discover which patient populations the physician finds most challenging to treat?",
      focusArea: "Patient segmentation",
      context: "Identify specific use cases where your solution adds value",
      whyItMatters: "Physicians are most receptive to solutions that address their toughest clinical challenges. Identifying these pain points helps you position your product where it can make the biggest difference.",
      howToUse: "Use this question to uncover specific patient profiles, comorbidities, or treatment-resistant cases. Follow up with: 'What makes this population particularly challenging?' to dig deeper."
    },
    {
      question: "What question would reveal the physician's current workflow and where inefficiencies exist?",
      focusArea: "Process understanding",
      context: "Map their current state to identify improvement opportunities",
      whyItMatters: "Workflow inefficiencies represent opportunities for your solution to add value beyond clinical efficacy. Understanding their process helps you position practical benefits like time savings, reduced administrative burden, or better patient monitoring.",
      howToUse: "Ask: 'Walk me through how you currently manage [condition]—from diagnosis to follow-up.' Listen for pain points, bottlenecks, and workarounds. These are opportunities to demonstrate value."
    }

  // Alias for stakeholder module
  "stakeholder": [
    {
      question: "How would you identify all the stakeholders involved in a hospital formulary decision beyond the primary contact?",
      focusArea: "Stakeholder identification",
      context: "Map the complete decision-making unit",
      whyItMatters: "Formulary decisions involve multiple stakeholders with different priorities. Missing a key decision-maker can derail your entire effort, even if your primary contact supports you.",
      howToUse: "Ask your primary contact: 'Who else is involved in evaluating new treatments?' and 'Whose approval is required before this moves forward?' Map the org chart and decision process."
    },
    {
      question: "What questions would you ask to understand the power dynamics between different stakeholders?",
      focusArea: "Influence mapping",
      context: "Identify who has veto power vs. advisory roles",
      whyItMatters: "Not all stakeholders have equal influence. Understanding who has veto power, who are influencers, and who are gatekeepers helps you prioritize your time and tailor your approach.",
      howToUse: "Ask: 'When decisions like this have been made in the past, whose input carried the most weight?' and 'Is there anyone who could block this even if others support it?'"
    },
    {
      question: "How would you tailor your message differently for a CFO vs. a Chief Medical Officer?",
      focusArea: "Audience adaptation",
      context: "Speak to each stakeholder's priorities and concerns",
      whyItMatters: "CFOs care about budget impact and ROI. CMOs care about clinical outcomes and quality of care. Using the same pitch for both wastes their time and shows you don't understand their role.",
      howToUse: "For CFOs: Lead with cost-effectiveness, budget impact, and financial outcomes. For CMOs: Lead with clinical efficacy, safety data, and patient outcomes. Adapt your evidence and language to their priorities."
    },
    {
      question: "What approach would you use to gain access to stakeholders who are difficult to reach?",
      focusArea: "Access strategy",
      context: "Leverage existing relationships and find creative entry points",
      whyItMatters: "Key decision-makers are often busy and hard to reach. Your ability to gain access through creative strategies and relationship leverage separates successful reps from those who get stuck at the gatekeeper level.",
      howToUse: "Ask your champion: 'What's the best way to get on [stakeholder]'s calendar?' Offer value upfront (e.g., relevant clinical data, peer insights). Use warm introductions whenever possible."
    },
    {
      question: "How would you document and track stakeholder relationships over time?",
      focusArea: "Relationship management",
      context: "Maintain institutional knowledge and continuity",
      whyItMatters: "Stakeholder relationships evolve. People change roles, priorities shift, and new decision-makers emerge. Systematic tracking ensures you maintain continuity and don't lose ground when changes occur.",
      howToUse: "Use your CRM to track: stakeholder roles, priorities, interaction history, and relationship strength. Update after every interaction. Review quarterly to identify gaps and opportunities."

      howToUse: "Ask: 'When decisions like this have been made in the past, whose input carried the most weight?'"
    },
    {
      question: "How would you uncover hidden influencers who aren't in formal decision-making roles?",
      focusArea: "Hidden influencers",
      context: "Find the informal power brokers and opinion leaders",
      whyItMatters: "Informal influencers often have more sway than their title suggests. They can be champions or blockers.",
      howToUse: "Ask: 'Who do people go to for advice on clinical matters?' Look for respected clinicians, long-tenured staff, and opinion leaders."
    },
    {
      question: "What approach would you use to understand each stakeholder's individual priorities and concerns?",
      focusArea: "Individual motivations",
      context: "Tailor your message to each stakeholder's unique perspective",
      whyItMatters: "Each stakeholder has unique priorities. Generic messaging fails to resonate with anyone.",
      howToUse: "Research their background, ask about their goals, and listen for what they emphasize. Adapt your message accordingly."
    },
    {
      question: "How would you navigate a situation where stakeholders have conflicting priorities?",
      focusArea: "Conflict resolution",
      context: "Find common ground and build consensus across competing interests",
      whyItMatters: "Conflicting priorities are common. Your ability to find common ground and build consensus is critical to moving deals forward.",
      howToUse: "Identify shared goals (e.g., patient outcomes, efficiency). Position your solution as addressing multiple priorities simultaneously."
