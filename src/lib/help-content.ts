These signals help the AI provide more personalized coaching.

## Example Conversations

**Call Preparation**:

- AI: Suggests research to do, key messages, potential objections, and opening strategies

**Skill Development**:
- You: "My active listening scores are low. How can I improve?"
- AI: Explains the skill, provides techniques, and offers practice exercises

## Conversation History

# Scores Not Updating

If your behavioral metric scores aren't updating after roleplays, try these solutions:

## Common Causes

### 1. Roleplay Not Completed
**Issue**: Scores only update after completing a full roleplay

**Solution**:
- Complete at least 5 message exchanges
- End the roleplay properly (don't just close the page)
- Wait for the feedback screen to appear

### 2. Browser Cache
**Issue**: Old scores cached in browser

**Solution**:
1. Refresh the EI Metrics page (F5 or Cmd+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Log out and log back in

### 3. Session Issues
**Issue**: Scores saved to wrong session

**Solution**:
1. Check if you're logged in
2. Verify you're using the same account
3. Clear chat history and start fresh session

## Verification Steps

1. **Complete a Test Roleplay**:
   - Do a quick 5-message roleplay
   - Note your starting scores
   - Complete the roleplay
   - Check if scores updated

2. **Check Roleplay Feedback**:
   - After roleplay, review the feedback screen
   - Scores should be displayed there
   - If they appear there but not in EI Metrics, it's a sync issue

3. **Refresh Multiple Times**:
   - Sometimes scores take 10-30 seconds to sync
   - Refresh the EI Metrics page a few times
   - Wait 1 minute between refreshes

## Understanding Score Updates

### How Scores Are Calculated
- Scores are based on your most recent roleplays
- Each metric is scored independently (0-100)
- Scores reflect patterns, not single messages
- More practice = more accurate scores

### When Scores Update
- **Immediately**: After completing a roleplay
- **Aggregated**: EI Metrics page shows rolling average
- **Historical**: Past scores are preserved

### Why Scores Might Not Change Much
- You're consistently performing at the same level
- Need more practice to show improvement
- Focusing on wrong areas (check feedback for guidance)

## Still Having Issues?

### Try This:
1. **Clear All Data**:
   - AI Coach: Clear chat history
   - Browser: Clear cache and cookies
   - Log out and log back in

2. **Start Fresh**:
   - Complete 3 new roleplays
   - Check if scores update after each one
   - If they do, the issue is resolved

3. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Press F12 (or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
   - Look for error messages
   - Take a screenshot if you see errors

### Report the Issue
If scores still don't update:
1. Note which metrics aren't updating
2. Record when you last saw them update
3. List recent roleplays you completed
4. Contact support with these details

## Prevention Tips

- Complete roleplays fully (don't abandon mid-conversation)
- Wait for feedback screen before closing
- Practice regularly (daily is best)
- Use the same browser and account
- Clear cache weekly

# Searching the Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base contains pharmaceutical sales resources, clinical information, and market access guidance. Here's how to find what you need:

## Search Methods

### 1. Keyword Search
- Type keywords in the search bar
- Use specific terms (e.g., "cardiovascular outcomes" not "heart")
- Try multiple search terms if first attempt doesn't work

### 2. Category Filtering
Browse by category:
- **Clinical Data**: Efficacy, safety, MOA, trial results
- **Market Access**: Formulary, reimbursement, payer strategies
- **Compliance**: Regulations, guidelines, legal requirements
- **Sales Techniques**: Methodologies, best practices, tips

### 3. AI-Powered Q&A
- Ask questions in natural language
- Get AI-generated answers based on article content
- Available on both article pages and main Knowledge Base page

## Search Tips

✅ **Be Specific**: "Phase 3 trial results cardiovascular" > "trial results"
✅ **Use Medical Terms**: "myocardial infarction" > "heart attack"
✅ **Try Synonyms**: "efficacy" = "effectiveness" = "outcomes"
✅ **Filter First**: Select category, then search within it
✅ **Use AI Q&A**: Ask "What are the key safety findings?" instead of searching

## AI Q&A Features

### General Q&A (Top of Page)
Ask questions about any topic:
- "What are the latest guidelines for diabetes management?"
- "How do I explain MOA to a busy physician?"
- "What's the difference between formulary tiers?"

- "What were the primary endpoints?"
- "How does this compare to competitors?"
- "What are the key takeaways for my specialty?"

## Finding Specific Information

### Clinical Data
**Search for**: Trial names, endpoints, efficacy rates, safety profiles
**Example**: "ASCEND trial primary endpoint"

### Market Access
**Search for**: Formulary status, prior authorization, reimbursement
**Example**: "Medicare Part D coverage criteria"

### Compliance

- Apply DISC to adapt Challenger approach
- Combine Active Listening with any framework

## AI-Powered Customization

For each framework, you can:

- **Customize Template**: Adapt framework to your specific situation
- **See Examples**: View pharma-specific use cases
- **Practice**: Apply in roleplay simulations

## Tips for Success

✅ **Start with One**: Master one framework before adding more
