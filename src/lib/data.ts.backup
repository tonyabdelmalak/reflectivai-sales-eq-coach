## Preclinical Testing
Before human trials, drugs undergo laboratory and animal testing to assess safety and biological activity.

## Clinical Trial Phases

### Phase 1
- 20-100 healthy volunteers
- Focus on safety and dosage
- Duration: Several months

### Phase 2
- 100-500 patients with condition
- Assess efficacy and side effects
- Duration: Several months to 2 years

### Phase 3
- 1,000-5,000 patients
- Confirm efficacy, monitor adverse reactions
- Duration: 1-4 years

## NDA/BLA Review
The New Drug Application or Biologics License Application is submitted with all clinical data. FDA review typically takes 10-12 months, with priority review available for breakthrough therapies.

Ongoing safety monitoring and additional studies after approval.`,

## Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)
The gold standard for establishing causality. Patients are randomly assigned to treatment or control groups.

### Blinding
- Single-blind: Patients don't know assignment
- Double-blind: Neither patients nor investigators know
- Open-label: All parties aware of assignment

### Control Types
- Placebo-controlled
- Active comparator
- Standard of care

### Endpoints
- Primary: Main outcome measure
- Secondary: Additional outcomes of interest
- Exploratory: Hypothesis-generating

## Statistical Considerations
- p-value: Probability result occurred by chance
- Confidence interval: Range of plausible values
- Hazard ratio: Comparison of event rates
