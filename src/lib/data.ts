## Preclinical Testing
Before human trials, drugs undergo laboratory and animal testing to assess safety and biological activity.

## Clinical Trial Phases

### Phase 1
- 20-100 healthy volunteers
- Focus on safety and dosage
- Duration: Several months

### Phase 2
- 100-500 patients with condition
- Assess efficacy and side effects
- Duration: Several months to 2 years

### Phase 3
- 1,000-5,000 patients
- Confirm efficacy, monitor adverse reactions
- Duration: 1-4 years

## NDA/BLA Review
The New Drug Application or Biologics License Application is submitted with all clinical data. FDA review typically takes 10-12 months, with priority review available for breakthrough therapies.

## Post-Marketing (Phase 4)
Ongoing safety monitoring and additional studies after approval.`,

## Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)
The gold standard for establishing causality. Patients are randomly assigned to treatment or control groups.

## Key Design Elements

### Blinding
- Single-blind: Patients don't know assignment
- Double-blind: Neither patients nor investigators know
- Open-label: All parties aware of assignment

### Control Types
- Placebo-controlled
- Active comparator
- Standard of care

### Endpoints
- Primary: Main outcome measure
- Secondary: Additional outcomes of interest
- Exploratory: Hypothesis-generating

## Statistical Considerations
- p-value: Probability result occurred by chance
- Confidence interval: Range of plausible values
- Hazard ratio: Comparison of event rates
- Number needed to treat: Patients to treat for one benefit`,

### Minimum Necessary Standard
Only access the minimum PHI needed for a specific purpose.

### Business Associate Agreements

### Security Safeguards
- Administrative controls
- Physical safeguards
- Technical measures

## Implications for Sales Reps
- Never request specific patient information
- Avoid looking at patient charts or records
- Be careful with sample signature logs

### WAC (Wholesale Acquisition Cost)
The manufacturer's list price to wholesalers. Often used as the starting point for negotiations.

### AWP (Average Wholesale Price)
A benchmark price, typically WAC plus a markup. Used in some reimbursement calculations.

### ASP (Average Sales Price)
Medicare Part B uses ASP plus 6% for reimbursement of physician-administered drugs.

## Discounts and Rebates
- Medicaid rebates (mandatory)
- Commercial rebates (negotiated)
- 340B program pricing
- Patient assistance programs

## Transparency Requirements
- Sunshine Act reporting
- State pricing laws
- Pipeline notification requirements

## Value-Based Discussions
Frame cost conversations around:
- Total cost of care
- Avoided hospitalizations
- Quality of life improvements
- Long-term outcomes`,
